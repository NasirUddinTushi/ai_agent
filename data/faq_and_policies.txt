What devices do you repair?
We repair most popular smartphones, tablets, and smartwatches, including all models of iPhone, Samsung Galaxy, Google Pixel, and many other Android devices. We also repair iPads, Samsung tablets, and Apple Watches. Additionally, we service gaming consoles (PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo), gaming controllers, laptops, and computers.

How long does a typical phone repair take?
Most standard repairs like screen replacements, battery replacements, and charging port fixes are completed within 1–2 hours. More complex repairs might take up to 24 hours. We’ll always provide you with an estimated completion time when you drop off your device.

Do you use original parts for repairs?
We offer both original manufacturer parts and high-quality aftermarket parts. Original parts maintain your device’s warranty but are more expensive. Our aftermarket parts are thoroughly tested for quality and compatibility, and come with our own warranty. We’ll discuss your options and pricing before beginning any repair.

Do I need to make an appointment for repairs?
While walk-ins are welcome, we recommend scheduling an appointment to minimize wait time. You can book online, by phone, or in person. We often have same-day appointments available for common repairs.

What warranty do you offer on repairs?
All repairs include a 90-day warranty on parts and labor. It covers defects but not new physical/water damage or third-party tampering.

What is your return policy?
- Refurbished Devices: 14-day return or exchange
- Accessories: 30-day unopened / 14-day opened
- Repairs: 7-day adjustment window if dissatisfied

How do you handle data privacy during repairs?
We take privacy seriously. All technicians sign confidentiality agreements. We recommend you back up/erase data before drop-off. We never access your files unless needed for repair testing.
